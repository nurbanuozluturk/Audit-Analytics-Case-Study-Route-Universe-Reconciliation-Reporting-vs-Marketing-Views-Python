# Audit Analytics Case Study: Route Universe Reconciliation (Python)

## Objective
This project demonstrates an audit analytics approach to reconcile two operational route universes used for different purposes:
- **Reporting view** (T_ONTIME_REPORTING.csv)
- **Marketing view** (T_ONTIME_MARKETING.csv)

The goal is to assess **coverage consistency**, identify **population definition differences**, and surface **exceptions** that may impact KPI reporting reliability and management decision-making.

## Scope
The analysis is performed at route level using the following identifiers:
- `ORIGIN_AIRPORT_ID`
- `DEST_AIRPORT_ID`

The dataset contains route universe information (not delay minutes or cancellation reasons). Therefore, the focus is on **population completeness and consistency**, rather than operational performance metrics.

## Methodology (Audit Tests)
The workflow is designed as a repeatable set of audit-style tests:

1. **Data Profiling & Integrity Checks**
   - Missing value review
   - Duplicate detection
   - Basic consistency checks on key fields

2. **Coverage Reconciliation**
   - Comparison of unique route pairs between Reporting vs Marketing views
   - Identification of routes present in Marketing but missing in Reporting (coverage gaps)

3. **Airport Universe Reconciliation**
   - Identification of airport IDs present only in the Marketing view

4. **Overcounting / Population Definition Risk Flags**
   - Route-level record count comparison
   - Flags for routes where the Marketing view shows materially higher record counts than the Reporting view
   - This supports risk-based monitoring and internal control-oriented discussions on reporting integrity

## Outputs
After execution, the script generates the following files under the `output/` folder:

- `audit_kpi_summary.csv`  
  High-level volume and uniqueness summary (routes, airports, null counts)

- `exceptions_routes_marketing_only.csv`  
  Unique routes present in Marketing but missing in Reporting

- `exceptions_airports_marketing_only.csv`  
  Airport IDs present only in the Marketing view

- `exceptions_overcounting_flags.csv`  
  Routes flagged for potential overcounting / population definition differences  
  (based on threshold rules configurable in the script)

- `audit_findings_for_report.txt`  
  Report-ready numeric statements (copy/paste into a 1-page audit note)

- `audit_findings_for_report.md` *(optional)*  
  Same findings in Markdown format
